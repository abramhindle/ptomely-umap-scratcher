Map and find things in your data with openGL to help make it pretty.

Mostly a personal weekend interest in looking at making a functional, fast map of some audio descriptor data + machine learning outputs.

It requires a Python 3.6+ environment and node package manager to run the web server and dependencies for drawing with three.js.

It makes use of the FluCoMa tools for audio analysis and statistics. Big thanks to the team at Huddersfield University for these tools!
